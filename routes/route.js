The major five are: Hydroelectricity, Solar, Wind, Geothermal, and Biofuel & Biomass","list":["Hydroelectricity - Using water's motion power to generate electricity is not a new concept; we have been doing so for around one hundred years and most countries have some form of water generated electricity source. There are two basic forms of using water for green energy needs. Hydroelectricity is produced by processing and controlling the flow of water through a dam. This is one of the most encouraging forms of renewable energy. Globally, it generates some 3,500 terawatts of power and has increased year on year since 2003. Hydroelectric power is likely to be one of our most common forms of energy production in the next few years and in the post oil world.","Solar - Solar power is arguably one of the best-known renewable energy sources and many argue that solar power should have been more common much earlier than it was. Interest began in the 19th century with the same people who understand that coal would eventually run out. Also, growing environmental awareness and the prominence of peak oil meant we once again need to look for cleaner energies.","Wind - We have captured the wind for thousands of years - it drove our ships until relatively recently, and in many places still grinds our wheat into flour. The same principle is behind the generation of electricity through the turbines of wind farms. At sea or on land, these giant spinning windmills capture the power of the air around it.","Geothermal - One of the most intriguing concepts of renewable energy is harnessing heat from under the surface of the planet produced as a result of geological processes such as natural heat loss, volcanic activity, or from perfectly normal and safe processes such as radioactive decay. We have used the heat of the Earth for centuries; hot springs all over the world have been places of spiritual significance and centers of settlement. Today there are many geothermal power processing plants across the world providing clean energy to local areas.","Biofuel - Biofuel is the production of the types of fuel we use in our vehicles from plants or other organic matter rather than from the fossil fuels extracted from the ground. \
                        Biomass - Biomass is different from biofuel in that it is waste organic material such as wood and other plant matter, and not a derivative byproduct that results from processing. Biomass is chopped wood (logs and kindling), gasses, leaves, brush and scrub, and other raw organic material that may burn and produce energy, including manure and animal dung.",],"background":"dark1"},]}),"template/page"],"history":[page({"title":"History","hero":{"src":"/assets/images/city2.jpg","alt":"An iamge of a bustling city."},"info":[{"title":"The Old Days","nopad":!0,"padTop":!0,"description":"Simple machines based on steam have been dated by some sources as far back as ancient Alexandria. The significant adaptations of Thomas Newcomen and James Watt in the mid 1700s that gave birth to the modern steam engine. A single steam engine, powered by coal dug from the mines, could do the work of dozens of horses. More convenient than wind and water, and less expensive than a stable full of horses, steam engines were soon powering locomotives, factories, and farm implements. Coal was also used for heating buildings and smelting iron into steel. In 1880, coal powered a steam engine attached to the world's first electric generator. Thomas Edison's plant in New York City provided the first electric light to Wall Street financiers and the New York Times. Only a year later, the world's first hydroelectric plant went on-line in Appleton, Wisconsin. Fast-flowing rivers that had turned wheels to grind corn were now grinding out electricity instead. By the late 1800s, a new form of fuel was catching on: petroleum. For years it had been a nuisance, contaminating wells for drinking water. Initially sold by hucksters as medicine, oil became a valuable commodity for lighting as the whale oil industry declined. By the turn of the century, oil, processed into gasoline, was firing internal combustion engines. When Henry Ford perfected the assembly-line method of mass production for his Model T. Electric cars were the rich’s toy at the same time. When gas cars adopted electric starters, their superior range quickly drove the electrics out of the market.","background":"dark2"},{"nopad":!0,"padBottom":!0,"img":{"src":"/assets/images/edison.jpg","alt":"An image of Edison"},"background":"dark2"},{"title":"Energy Takes Off","description":"With the low-cost automobile and the spread of electricity, society's energy use changed. Power plants became larger and larger. Power lines extended hundreds of miles between cities, bringing electricity to rural areas. Energy use grew quickly, doubling every 10 years. The cost of energy production was declining steadily, and the efficient use of energy was simply not a concern. After World War II unleashed nuclear power, the government looked for a home for \"the peaceful atom.\" They found it in electricity production. Over 200 nuclear power plants were planned across the country, and homes were built with all-electric heating systems to take advantage of this power that would be \"too cheap to meter.\" Gasoline use grew unchecked as well. Cars grew larger and heavier throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By 1970, the average mileage of an American car was only 13.5 miles per gallon, and a gallon of gas cost less than a quarter.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/city4.jpg","alt":"An image of a City."},},{"title":"The Great Energy Crash","description":"In 1973, American support for Israel in the Arab-Israeli War led the Arab oil-producing nations to stop supplying oil to the United States and other western nations. Overnight, oil prices tripled. In 1979, when the Shah of Iran was forced out by the Ayatollah Khomeini, oil prices leaped again, rising 150 percent in a matter of weeks. Motorists lined up at gas stations to buy gasoline, and President Carter went on television to declare that energy conservation was \"the moral equivalent of war.\" By 1980, the average price of a barrel of oil was almost $45. Only three months after the fall of the Shah, the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant suffered a partial meltdown after a series of mechanical failures and operator mistakes. After years of hearing that a nuclear accident could never happen, the American public was shocked. The accident added to the sense of crisis. But the accident at Three Mile Island was only the latest in a long line of problems plaguing the nuclear industry. New plant orders had already ceased, because of multibillion-dollar cost overruns, high inflation, and a slowdown in electricity demand growth due to the early effects of energy conservation. No new plants were ordered after 1978, and all those ordered since 1973 have been canceled.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/stars2.jpg","alt":"An image of Stars."},"background":"dark2"},{"title":"Modern Times","description":"Shockingly, demand has outstripped supply since 1986, spurring on economists, scientific researchers and environmental campaigners to hasten its demise by campaigning that what is in the ground to remain in the ground. Instability in oil-producing countries has led to fluctuations, particularly since the 1990s, and that has brought another issue to the world's attention - energy security. Energy security has been a major concern to world leaders since the end of the 20th century, but even more so since the beginning of the 21st century. The term refers to the link between each country's national security, and the availability of that country to resources for energy production and consumption. If a country loses, or finds it has restricted access, to oil and other resources, instability is likely as energy is rationed. Energy security can be the result of armed conflict or political instability in gas or oil-producing countries, or a buying country having access restricted when a producing country deliberately cuts a supply.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/city.jpg","alt":"An image of Stars."},"background":"dark1"},],}),"template/page"],"actions":[page({"title":"Actions","hero":{"src":"/assets/images/city3.jpg","alt":"An iamge of a bustling city."},"info":[{"title":"How has the government reacted to this issue?

Almost half that investment – about $4.5 billion – was in Ontario which adopted a green energy plan in 2009 and has been investing in solar and wind. But other provinces also moved forward to adopt renewables, including Quebec with $3.9 billion in investment, mainly in wind, British Columbia with $1.34 billion in hydro and Alberta with $930 million in wind investment. The government's current position on the issue is to tackle it with policies and incentives as well as investing more in green tech, and less in un-renewable energy to help Canada reach it green goal.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/logo/Flag_of_Canada.svg","alt":"The flag of Canada."},"background":"dark2"},{"title":"What agencies are working to solve this problem?","background":"dark1","nopad":!0,"padTop":!0,},{"nopad":!0,"split":[{"fullImage":!0,"img":{"src":"/assets/images/logo/IRENA_logo.svg","alt":"The IRENA Logo"},}],"background":"dark1"},{"nopad":!0,"padBottom":!0,"description":"The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future, and serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resource and financial knowledge on renewable energy.

There are various forms of renewable energy, deriving directly or indirectly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. They include energy generated from solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower and ocean resources, solid biomass, biogas and liquid biofuels. Biomass, however, is a renewable resource only if its rate of consumption does not exceed its rate of regeneration.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/windmill1.jpg","alt":"Pictures of wind mills."},"background":"dark1"},{"title":"Why use renewable energy?","description":"Renewable energy is needed because it provide benefits some like: Environmental Benefits: Renewable energy technologies are clean sources of energy that have a much lower environmental impact than conventional energy technologies. Energy for our children's children's children: Renewable energy will not run out. Ever. Other sources of energy are finite and will someday be depleted, Jobs and the Economy: Most renewable energy investments are spent on materials and workmanship to build and maintain the facilities, rather than on costly energy imports, and Energy Security: After the oil supply disruptions of the early 1970s, America has increased its dependence on foreign oil supplies instead of decreasing it. This increased dependence impacts more than just the national energy policy.","img":{"src":"/assets/images/windmill2.jpg","alt":"Pictures of a wind mill in a sunset"}},{"title":"Why don't we use more renewable energy?","description":"In general, renewable energy is more expensive to produce and to use than fossil fuel energy.

Like most renewables, solar and wind are exceedingly cheap to operate—their “fuel” is free, and maintenance is minimal—so the bulk of the expense comes from building the technology. The average cost in 2017 to install solar systems ranged from a little over $2,000 per kilowatt for large-scale systems to almost $3,700 for residential systems. Higher construction costs might make financial institutions more likely to perceive renewables as risky, lending money at higher rates and making it harder for utilities or developers to justify the investment.",},],"background":"dark1"},{"title":"What are the benefits of renewable energy?","description":"All energy sources have some impact on our environment.
